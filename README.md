# OOLA

## Features:

The project consists of two C# files: Program.cs and Profile.cs.

The Profile class contains fields for storing user information, such as name, age, city, country, pronouns, and hobbies.

The Profile class has a constructor to initialize the profile with basic information (name, age, city, country, and pronouns).

Users can set their hobbies using the SetHobbies method of the Profile class.

The ViewProfile method displays the user's profile information, including their name, age, city, country, pronouns, and hobbies.

## Usage:

Open the project in a C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with C# extension).

Compile and run the application.

The Main method in Program.cs creates a new Profile object, sets hobbies, and displays the profile information.

## Note:

This project serves as a starting point for more advanced dating profile applications.

The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of classes, fields, constructors, and methods in C#.

Feel free to explore and expand upon the code to add more features or enhance the functionality according to your needs.
